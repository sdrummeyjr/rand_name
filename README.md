# **Random Nickname Picker**

This is my first attempt at writing a program in Rust. There was a lot of laughing, a lot of crying, but eventually I got it to compile. It still needs some fixing, but it compiles and runs kind of correctly.

To Be Fixed:
* When picking a name from the vector, it prints with 'Some()' included in the output. I need to figure out how to simply print the word it picks.


Some thoughts after playing around with Rust:
So far I find the language fascinating and plan on sticking with it. It is veeeery different from Python, which I've been playing around with for almost a year and have become fairly proficient in (mostly regarding programming for data analysis and extending excel). These vast differences are why I picked Rust as I want to learn more about systems programming with the intent on writing programs to extend Python. Obviously, based on this dumb random name picker program, I have a long way to go, but am looking foward to the challenge :)
